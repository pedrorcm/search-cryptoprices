# search-cryptoprices
script that returns cryptoprices

How to use:

1 Enter your coinmarketcap API key on key file

2 In main.py, last line, enter the coin's code that you want the price.


It will return you the coin's price and search date.



***to-do list:***

Soon i will update this code and add more functionalities. My plans:

Make it write the data in a CSV file, so the user can follow prices overtime;

Make a tracker to the top 20 coins;
Show the variance in 24h;
Make the script run automatically at 00h;
